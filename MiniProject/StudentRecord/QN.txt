stud_add.c:

2)	This function should create a new block dynamically to store the information of a student (rollno, name, percentage) and link it appropriately into the single linked list.
3)	When a new record is created the rollno should be automatically the least positive number available without duplication.
4)	Users must input the name and percentage of the student.

stud_del.c:
1)	A function stud_del, when called from the menu should prompt a sub-menu(fig.2) to delete a record “based on rollno”, “based on name”.
2)	If identical names existing, then all the records with the same name should be display, so that user can identify the rollno to delete.
